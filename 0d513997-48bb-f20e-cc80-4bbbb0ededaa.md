---  
  
The [BRepBuilderPersistentIds](c9dd5c21-1d35-9f12-ec28-553e699a6ee2.md) type exposes the following members.

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AddSubTag](c8bf3c16-6864-8323-3c57-c132e9282473.md) | Adds a correspondence between an ExternalGeometryId and a BRepBuilderGeometryId. Note that an existing correspondence in the map cannot be updated and that a particular BRepBuilderGeometryId may be related to at most one ExternalGeometryId. |
|  | [Dispose](73d61523-7280-b04d-480f-9ae04a9373af.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified object is equal to the current object.(Inherited from Object) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as the default hash function.(Inherited from Object) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance.(Inherited from Object) |
|  | [IsAssociatedBRepBuilderValid](817496ab-6542-91cf-247d-6455add3df09.md) | Validates the associated (in the constructor) BRepBuilder for this BRepBuilderPersistentIds. |
|  | [IsBRepBuilderGeometryIdFaceOrEdge](22fae990-9618-4ea0-3fc7-775000c40a94.md) | Validates the input BRepBuilderGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, the input BRepBuilderGeometryId must represent the ID of either a Face or an Edge. |
|  | [IsValidBRepBuilderGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence](1d7e2823-e05b-2519-a55b-1b3075744497.md) | Validates the input BRepBuilderGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, a correspondence for the input BRepBuilderGeometryId must not already exist. |
|  | [IsValidExternalGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence](634779e5-d3d2-c68c-ccc8-07731fe44486.md) | Validates the input ExternalGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, a correspondence for the input ExternalGeometryId must not already exist. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object.(Inherited from Object) |

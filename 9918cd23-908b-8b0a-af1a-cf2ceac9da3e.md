|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [OnCurve](6306ac1d-c259-5617-f71b-c13e54e5af0d.md) | This method is called when a Curve is being output. (Inherited from [IExportContextBase](6691ecd5-a88a-1f58-7a71-a8f6233b6c51.md)) |
|  | [OnLineSegment](5fe0cee4-825b-9828-2c45-5e4c5019bc37.md) | This method is called after unhandled curve was tessellated to line segments and sent to the output. Note for 2D export: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style, then |

  * this method is called outside of view, instance and link begin/end calls but still between OnElementBegin2D/OnElementEnd2D calls
  * this method is never called for annotation elements, i.e. their geometry should be processed in methods OnCurve and OnPolyline

(Inherited from [IExportContextBase](6691ecd5-a88a-1f58-7a71-a8f6233b6c51.md))  
| [OnPoint](6d0a592f-9961-e0ff-70a3-b67bb815e0d4.md)|  This method is called when a Point is being output.   
| [OnPolyline](12a8d0af-f3e2-e5f3-aa19-797adebaff2b.md)|  This method is called when a Polyline is being output. (Inherited from [IExportContextBase](6691ecd5-a88a-1f58-7a71-a8f6233b6c51.md))  
| [OnPolylineSegments](c3891505-dd89-50d4-519e-5380af669325.md)|  This method is called after unhandled curve was tessellated to polyline segments and sent to the output. Note for 2D export: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style, then

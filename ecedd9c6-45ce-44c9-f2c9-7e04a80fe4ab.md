|  | [OnInstanceBegin](2db35bdb-8d14-a015-9bfb-9283f503edab.md) | This method marks the start of processing of an instance node (e.g. a family instance). (Inherited from [IExportContext](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.md)) |
|  | [OnInstanceEnd](d1340660-fcc9-3bfd-58fb-8d114aa39517.md) | This method marks the end of processing of an Instance Node (e.g. a family instance). (Inherited from [IExportContext](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.md)) |

  * this method is called outside of view, instance and link begin/end calls but still between OnElementBegin2D/OnElementEnd2D calls
  * this method is never called for annotation elements, i.e. their geometry should be processed in methods OnCurve and OnPolyline

  
| [OnPolymesh](6a060c37-3225-217e-b150-2eaea3a22c29.md)|  This method is called when a tessellated polymesh of a 3d face is being output. (Inherited from [IExportContext](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.md))
